YYDebug Info: Extended debug information for Game Maker Studio 2
===================================

``YYDebug Info`` is a Game Maker Studio 2 extension used to access your game's GML source code from in-game.
With this extension, you can access the current callstack to display the current line of code associated with a particular script/line number.
YYDebug Info also contains functions for displaying the entire source code given a particular script name or ID.

This can come in handy if you want to throw more detailed exceptions during the debugging process, as Game Maker currently does not allow you to access the source code from in-game.
